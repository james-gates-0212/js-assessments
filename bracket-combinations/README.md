# Bracket Combinations

Have the function `BracketCombinations(num)` read `num` which will be an integer greater than or equal to zero, and return the number of valid combinations that can be formed with num pairs of parentheses. For example, if the input is 3, then the possible combinations of 3 pairs of parenthesis, namely: `()()()`, are `()()()`, `()(())`, `(())()`, `((()))`, and `(()())`. There are 5 total combinations when the input is 3, so your program should return 5.

## Examples

```javascript
BracketCombinations(2); // should == 2
BracketCombinations(3); // should == 5
```

## Execute

```bash
node solution.js
```
